### Group Members: Sean Mitchell, Jason Mora-Mendoza

### How to run:
~$ make
### Summary


### Project Requirements
#### 1. Executing the Prim-Jarnik algorithm by hand
- [x] Complete Exercises 6-3 (b) and 6-3 (c) from Algorithm Design in Three Acts.
#### 2. Reproducing the example graphs in C++
- [x] Implement Exercises 6-3 (b) and 6-3 (c) Set the graph to be undirected, and insert undirected edges.
- [x] Once the graph is constructed, traverse the data structure and print out each vertex, edge, and weight.
#### 3. Implementing the Prim-Jarnik algorithm
- [ ] implement the Prim-Jarnik algorithm as a function on NGraph::Graph objects and weight matrices. Output each edge in the minimum spanning tree and its total weight.
